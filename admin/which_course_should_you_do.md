<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There are two main statistics courses available this semester.</p>
<p><strong>161.111 Applied Statistics</strong> is an introductory course that covers the basics of statistics using Excel and R/RStudio. It is suited to those that have less computing or mathematical background, and is a good first start if you haven't done statistics before or are less familiar with computers.<br></p>
<p><strong>297.101 Statistical Data Science</strong> is for those with computationally focused majors (CS, IT, Maths, Chemistry, Statistics, Data Science) and for those that are likely to use computational tools in their majors (Psychology, Ecology, Earth Science).</p>
<p>In this course there is a strong focus on using computing to explore statistical concepts. These tools allow us to go into a little more depth than is done in 161.111.</p>
<p>Those that have already done 161.111 are ofcourse welcome to follow up with 297.101.<br></p>
<p>If you're unsure which course is best for you, then please let me know.<br></p>
